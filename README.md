# INNIT

This is a work in progress with a lot of features yet to be added
USE AT OWN RISK

This is to ease initial setup of a new Computer for personal use
In addition to above, this should also help in creating a minimum set
of tools and configs that can be quickly and easily deployed on systems

The following are the tools that I will like to get done by today:

1) Tmux
2) Tsundere
3) Bashrc
4) zshrc
5) package installations
6) Home directory organisation and policies regarding it
7) Git repo policies
8) Workshop analogy
